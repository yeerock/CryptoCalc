### Interactive Profit Charting

Visualize your profit potential over time. The integrated chart is more than just a static image; it's a dynamic tool for analyzing how price fluctuations impact your bottom line.

-   **Dynamic Time Ranges**: Switch between views from 5 minutes to 7 days to see both short-term volatility and long-term trends.
-   **Color-Coded Gains/Losses**: The chart line automatically changes color from green (profit) to red (loss), making it easy to see your break-even point.
-   **Detailed Tooltips**: Hover over the chart to see the exact profit/loss, coin price, and timestamp for any point in time.
-   **Persistent History**: Chart data is saved to your browser's IndexedDB, so your profit history persists across sessions.

## üíª Local Development & Setup

Since this is a single-file application with no build process, setting it up locally is extremely simple.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yeerock/CryptoCalc.git
    cd CryptoCalc
    ```
2.  **Serve the file:**
    The file is named `index.php`, but it contains no server-side PHP code. You can rename it to `index.html`. You'll need a local web server to prevent potential CORS issues when the app calls the Binance API.

    *   **Using Python's built-in server:**
        ```bash
        # Python 3
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
    *   **Using VS Code's Live Server extension:**
        Right-click the `index.php` file and choose "Open with Live Server".

3.  **Open in your browser:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. You're all set!
